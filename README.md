# Project Overview
# Real Time Threatening Intelligence and Risk management for Smart Shop Solutions

E-commerce companies like ShopSmart Solutions are facing a growing range of cyberthreats in today's quickly changing digital environment, which have the potential to breach private consumer information, interfere with business operations, and harm a brand's reputation. Our six-person team will work together to develop and put into practice a Real-Time Threat Intelligence and Risk Management Framework in order to solve these issues. By incorporating Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) technologies, adhering to the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)and Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0, and automating risk assessment procedures, this project seeks to improve ShopSmart Solutions' security posture. We will use Git for version control and collaboration, use risk management concepts, and make use of OSINT tools with open API access in this practical project. Our objective is to provide a strong framework that permits proactive risk mitigation techniques catered to the particular requirements of an e-commerce company, real-time threat monitoring, and risk analysis. Our goal is to provide ShopSmart Solutions with a complete solution at the conclusion of this project that not only recognizes and evaluates risks but also offers useful information to bolster its cybersecurity defenses. Our team will also get the chance to gain hands-on experience in threat intelligence, risk management, and collaborative Git project management through this project. Every team member will offer their area of expertise to guarantee the project's successful completion, in accordance with the NIST guidelines, and the provision of a scalable, real-time risk management system.
