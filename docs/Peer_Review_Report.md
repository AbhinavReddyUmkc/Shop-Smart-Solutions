## Recommendations for Future Development
1. Implement more comprehensive automated testing
2. Consider breaking down the backend into microservices
3. Add more granular permission controls
4. Improve dashboard performance with more efficient data loading
5. Consider implementing GraphQL for more flexible API queries
