## Best Practices

### Effective Investigation

Follow these best practices for investigation:
- Start with high-severity alerts
- Look for correlated events
- Use the timeline view for context
- Check external threat intelligence
- Document your findings

### Response Workflow

Recommended incident response workflow:
1. Acknowledge the alert
2. Gather initial information
3. Determine scope and impact
4. Contain if necessary
5. Investigate root cause
6. Remediate and recover
7. Document lessons learned

## Workflow Examples
