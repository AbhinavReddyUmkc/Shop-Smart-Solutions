# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) & Risk Management Framework (RMF) Summary

## Overview
The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and **Risk Management Framework (RMF)** are essential guidelines for managing cybersecurity risks. They provide structured approaches to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, which are critical for our Real-Time Threat Intelligence (RTTI) project.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0

### Core Functions
1. **Identify**: Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, and data.
2. **Protect**: Implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
3. **Detect**: Develop activities to identify cybersecurity events.
4. **Respond**: Take action regarding detected cybersecurity events.
5. **Recover**: Restore capabilities and services after a cybersecurity event.

### Implementation Tiers
- **Tier 1 (Partial)**: Ad-hoc risk management practices.
- **Tier 2 (Risk Informed)**: Risk-aware but not consistently implemented.
- **Tier 3 (Repeatable)**: Consistently applied risk management practices.
- **Tier 4 (Adaptive)**: Dynamic and adaptive risk management.

### Relevance to Project
- Helps in **risk assessment** and **threat intelligence integration**.
- Guides the development of a **risk-aware RTTI system**.

## NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF)

### 6 Steps of RMF
1. **Categorize**: Define the system and its impact level.
2. **Select**: Choose appropriate security controls.
3. **Implement**: Apply controls and document how they are deployed.
4. **Assess**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the controls.
5. **Authorize**: Make a risk-based decision to authorize the system.
6. **Monitor**: Continuously track changes and update controls.

### Integration with SDLC
- RMF aligns with the **System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** to ensure security is embedded from the start.
- Emphasizes **continuous monitoring** to adapt to evolving threats.

### Relevance to Project
- Provides a structured approach to **risk management**.
- Ensures our RTTI system is **secure and compliant** with best practices.

## Key Takeaways
- **NIST CSF** focuses on **risk management** through its core functions and implementation tiers.
- **NIST RMF** provides a **step-by-step process** for integrating security into system development.
- Both frameworks emphasize **continuous monitoring** and **adaptive risk management**, which are critical for our RTTI system.
